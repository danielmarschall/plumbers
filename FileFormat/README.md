## File format of the PC version

The PC version saves its information about the pictures and scenes in the file  **GAME.BIN**. The game is divided into scenes. Scenes have actions. If a scene has only 1 action, this action will be automatically chosen (e.g. to go to the next scene, or to end the game). If there are more than one action defined, the user will see the decision page with hotspots on it.

See the  [C/C++ headers](https://github.com/danielmarschall/plumbers/tree/master/FileFormat/C)  as well as the  [Delphi source](https://github.com/danielmarschall/plumbers/tree/master/FileFormat/Delphi).
